# Creator Monetization

Copy for LLMView as Markdown

The creator monetization program lets Poe bot creators get paid. See program details on the [creator monetization program page](https://help.poe.com/hc/en-us/articles/21921312368020-Poe-Creator-Monetization-FAQs) and on the [Creators page](https://poe.com/creators) on the Poe website. Part of the program includes setting earnings more flexibly per message from within the bot’s code (see [Poe Bot Monetization API Documentation](https://creator.poe.com/docs/server-bots/poe-bot-monetization-api-documentation)).

If for any reason the above program does not meet your needs as a developer, please reach out to us at [developers@poe.com.](mailto:developers@poe.com.) We can work out custom arrangements.
