### [1\. Can I monetize my app or bot through alternative means not supported by the platform?](https://creator.poe.com/docs/resources/frequently-asked-questions\#1-can-i-monetize-my-app-or-bot-through-alternative-means-not-supported-by-the-platform)

Yes, you are welcome to monetize your bot through alternative means which include, but are not limited to, placing ads in your content or asking users to visit your website to make donations or payments.

No, we will not use the responses from your bot to train LLMs, nor will we provide your bot's responses to any third party unless we have an agreement in place to prevent the use of responses for this purpose. This is specified in our [API terms](https://poe.com/api_terms) in section 4.c.
